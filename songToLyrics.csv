For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

Oh, ooh
Please don't take

I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

Oh, ooh

Yo puedo comerte como a ti te gusta
Si solo te dejas querer
En caliente yo voy por ti
Mija, aquí no muerdo, no se me asuste
No hay más tiempo que perder
Solo se vive una vez

Soy la mala influencia y eso te gustó
Eres niña mala, se nota, mi amor
Eres una diabla, mira cómo bailas
Del uno al diez, tú eres un millón
Si te vas conmigo, puro Christian Dior
Fendi, Balenciaga, pa' ti me sobra lana
Lo que quieras, mi amor
Mi chula princesa, te bajo la luna
Y si te dejas, verás quе ninguno te va a dar lo que yo te voy a dar

Erеs una diabla

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times

As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face
And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back

"384,154,381",Jack Harlow,Lovin On Me,Global,"50 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschEspañolPortuguêsLovin On Me Lyrics
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

I'm vanilla, baby (I don't like no whips and chains)
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby (And you can't tie me down)
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby (But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby)
I get love in Detroit like Skilla Baby (Whip your lovin' on me, baby)
And the thing about your boy is
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby (That's right, that's right)
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

Young J-A-C-K, AKA
Rico like Suave, Young Enrique
Speakin' of AKA, she's a alpha
But not around your boy, she get quiet 'round your boy, hold on (Shh)
Don't know what you heard or what you thought about your boy
But they lied about your boy, goin' dumb and it's somethin' idiotic 'bout your boy
She wearin' cheetah print
That's how bad she wanna bе spotted 'round your boy

I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie mе down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me
You might also like
I'm vanilla, baby (I don't like no whips and chains)
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby (And you can't tie me down)
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby (But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby)
I get love in Detroit like Skilla Baby (Whip your lovin' on me, baby)
And the thing about your boy is
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

Young M-I-S-S-I-O-N-A-R-Y
You sharp like barbed wire
She stole my heart, then she got archived
I keep it short with a bitch, Lord Farquaad
All the girls in the front row (Ayy)
All the girls at the barricade (Ayy)
All the girls that been waitin' all day
Let your tongue hang out, fuck everything (Ayy)
If you came with a man (Came with a man)
Let go of his hand (Let go of that shit)
Everybody in the suite kickin' up they feet
Stand up, bitch, dance

I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down (I see you, and all the guys in the back waitin' on the next track)
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby (Cut your boy a lil' slack)
Whip your lovin' on me (It's young Jack)
I'm vanilla, baby (I don't like no whips and chains)
I'll choke you, but I ain't no killer, baby (And you can't tie me down)
She twenty-eight, tellin' me I'm still a baby (But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby)
I get love in Detroit like Skilla Baby (Whip your lovin' on me, baby)
And the thing about your boy is
I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby (That's right, that's right)
Whip your lovin' on me, baby

I don't like no whips and chains and you can't tie me down
But you can whip your lovin' on me, baby
